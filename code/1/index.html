    When writing a SPA, browser will parse the HTML and any JavaScript and then we need to initialize or bootstrap the application.
    For now, we are going to do that right on this page in the simplest way possible.
  -->
  <script type="text/javascript">
    var helloWorldElement = React.createElement("div", null, "Hello World");

    ReactDOM.render(
      helloWorldElement,
      document.getElementById("root")
    );
  </script>

  Why this?

  To highlight the basic building blocks.
  At the end of the day, a front end app is an HTML page with JS executing in the browser. With a front end app, the entire app
    is delivered to the web browser, and thats it.
  Don't even need a web server to serve this... this is an important concept.

  React.createElement and ReactDOM.render are building blocks of React.
  This also shows the core concepts of react. No 2-way binding. Just render stuff. When it changes, render it again.

  In production app for client, would probably skip this step unless I was helping someone learn.
