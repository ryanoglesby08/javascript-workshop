    When writing a SPA, browser will parse the HTML and any JavaScript and then we need to initialize or bootstrap the application.
    For now, we are going to do that right on this page in the simplest way possible.
  -->
  <script type="text/javascript">
    var helloWorld = React.createElement("div", null, "Hello World");
    // React.createElement(component|tag, props, children) --> Create and return a new React element, in memory, not rendered
    // This is part of the special sauce, React has a clear separation between JS and the DOM, explicit about when DOM is modified

    ReactDOM.render(
      helloWorld,
      document.getElementById("root")
    );
    // ReactDOM.render(component, container) --> Render a React element into the DOM in the supplied container
    // If the React element was previously rendered into container, this will perform an update on it
    //  and only mutate the DOM as necessary to reflect the latest React element. (performance and efficiency)

    // Applications built with just React usually have a single root DOM node. If you are integrating React into an existing app,
    //  you may have as many isolated root DOM nodes as you like.

    // This will likely be the only time in a React app where you do document.getElementById()! :)

  1. HTML skeleton - index-0.html
  2. Hello world and `open index.html`
    - `open` should open it up in your default browser. If not, `pwd`, copy and paste into browser url bar
  3. React.createElement, then ReactDOM.render, then div#root
  4. Add inline script tags
  5. Why this first?

  6. Review.
  7. git init. git add. git commit.

<!--
  Why this?

  To highlight the basic building blocks.
  At the end of the day, a front end app is an HTML page with JS executing in the browser. With a front end app, the entire app
    is delivered to the web browser, and thats it.
  Don't even need a web server to serve this... this is an important concept.

  React.createElement and ReactDOM.render are building blocks of React.
  This also shows the core concepts of react. No 2-way binding. Just render stuff. When it changes, render it again.

  Obviously, inline JS does not scale very well.
  React.createElement is clunky and a bit obfuscated. Going to get into cleaner way to write it and move away from the inline stuff.

  In production app for client, would probably skip this step unless I was helping someone learn.
