You need...
---------------

* node and npm
```
  $ brew install node
  $ node -v   => v6.x.x or v7.x.x
  $ npm -v    => v3.x.x or v4.x.x
```

* A web browser: Chrome is preferred. (Consider deactivating extensions)
* A code editor: IntelliJ, Atom, Sublime, vim. Whatever you like. :)
* <CHAT_CHANNEL_INFO>
* To be comfortable running commands in the terminal

It works like this:
---------------

* Some modules will be guided by me, some will be self-guided.
* I will send you links and code snippets in the chatroom.
* The entire workshop is on Github: <https://github.com/ryanoglesby08/javascript-workshop>
* Coming and going won’t work out too well. Each module builds on the previous one.
* Let’s do this!

The Plan:
---------------

* History of Javascript (optional)
* **Functional thinking** in JavaScript
